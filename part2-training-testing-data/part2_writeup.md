# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?

This model is more effective because we tested it using real data points from our dataset to confirm it's accuracy and ability to represent our data.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The R squared value tells us how well our training data points are correlated.


3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I would say that my model is actually not very accurate. Sometimes, the R squared value isn't high enough to consider a strong correlation and the predictions made compared to the actual values are usually too far off. Considering what is said in the American Heart Association's website, I believe that with the data we're provided it wouldn't be possible to make a highly accurate model as the only corresponding data point is age which isn't the only factor.
