# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.

The low spending score and low income group is "Hard Working"
- These people may not have much, but they live by their means.
The high spending score and low income group is "Loves stuff"
- They might not have that much money but they still need to buy their stuff.
The medium spending score and medium income group is "Keen Consumer"
- While they're not buying things crazy, they're still getting things and can reasonably afford them.
The low spending score and high income group is "Saving"
- They're just saving all their money. Would probably be hard to convince them to buy a roomba.
The high spending score and high income group is "High Rollers"
- They're wealthy and they buy many things, just sell them whatever.

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?

They would likely be grouped with the "high income low spending habits" group which is "Saving".

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?

For the high income low spending score group, you could likely tailor to them by selling them products that might be cost effective, neccessary, or productive for them. For example, a washing machine, a winter coat, a power efficient light bulb, things that you can reasonably justify purchasing with a low chance of buyer's remorse since you would just need them.
